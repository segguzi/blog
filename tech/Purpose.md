As a young boy growing up in Suburban Maryland, my friends and I had pretty wild imaginations. We did everything from buidling 
forts in the woods to making creative YouTube Videos for our channel ([One Tower Productions](https://www.youtube.com/user/OneTowerProductions)). <br />

We recently caught up via Zoom, and one of my close friends in the group shared how he really enjoyed creating as opposed to purely consuming. He also pointed
out that our experience growing up taught us something: Any skill in life is yours for the taking. You need only have the desire for it,
and the ability to poke and prod and make mistakes until you figure it out. Our group of kids learned how to upload and promote videos on Youtube,
camera skills, video editing, photo shop, script writing, architecture, carpentry, prop design, among many other skills.

Now that I am working as an engineer, I want to revitalize that kind of learning and skill building in myself. So I've decided to teach myself software engineering.
Partly because I think it's a great career move - I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, and adding software and web development skills is pretty huge.
But also because I want to create. I want to make meaningful change. I want to be put in the situation where I don't know how to accomplish what I want, so I
have to go figure it out. In my childhood the tools for that were hammers, nails, and cameras. Now, the tools are software languages, web development frameworks, and code libraries.

So, I've built this blog using Next.js, whcih is built on React. It's a good step but this is only the beginning. I'll be blogging about my experience, what I'm learning, how I'm figuring things out,
and how that eventually pays off for me. I have a lot of ideas I want to try out - ideas I've never been able to do before, ideas I don't currently have the skills to implement right now.
But I'll learn them. And hopefully you can learn something from my journey as well, or be inspired to go and learn something new.
