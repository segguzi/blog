As part of my journey I'll be taking a course on Udemy called [Spring & Hibernate for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/). <br />

According to Wikipedia:
> "The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application."

The Spring framework was created originally in 2002. However Spring Boot came out in April 2014. Since it is a slightly older framework, there are a lot of companies using it to build applications.

Aside from Spring Boot, the course also covers Hibernate. According to Wikipedia:
> "Hibernate ORM (or simply Hibernate) is an objectâ€“relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database."

I'm excited to learn Java development and start building my own apps!
