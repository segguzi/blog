Everybody has heard the phrase 'diet and exercise.' And if you're anything like me, you kind of choose to ignore
that ugly first word and focus more on the second. Dieting isn't really necessary as long as you exercise, right?

**Wrong!**

Both are absolutely essential to a healthy lifestyle. In fact, the general rule of thumb is that 70% of your efforts
should be in the kitchen, and only 30% in the gym. It's not sexy, but it's the truth. And the truth will make you.. sexy. 
Ok that was bad, I'm sorry. Moving on...

So many fitness plans fail because people spend hours at the gym without a thought to their diet. Then after blood sweat and tears, they despair because they haven't lost any weight!
Generally, **dieting and nutrition will help you lose fat** - working out won't do that for you. 
**Working out will build muscle** (size, tone, endurance, etc.) - obviously dieting won't do that for you.

Now, granted the two 'feed' into each other. The more you work out, the more calories you will burn - and subsequently need to replace, which often leads to eating more! Additionally what you eat can dictate energy and motivation levels, 
which will affect how you perform. The good news is that you can stick to a few very simple rules of thumb - no complicated diet restrictions,
no expensive workout plans. Mostly it's just common sense, and dedication to gradual lifestyle change. Let's start with food, and then get to exercise in the next post.

My wife and I recently have been thinking about all the different ways you can diet. You can go on a fad diet, you can use a service, etc. etc.
But those are complicated, expensive, and time consuming. So forget about that. Here is what I've found to be sustainable and effective - boiled down 
to just three rules:

- Cut out sugary drinks and foods (like desert, sugary coffe drinks, soda, etc.)

- Only eat **one** serving at every meal (so make sure to get a sufficiently sized serving!)

- No snacking between meals

If I had to sum up why this diet works it would be three words: Simple, Easy, and Flexible. Like every diet plan should be. Committing to these simple rules 
was the most effective way to drop body fat I've ever experienced (and I've tried a lot of diets...) 

I promise you if you do this for a week you will notice a difference. For me, I noticed how much I was eating during the day between meals; trail mix, crackers, chips, etc. 
I would always stuff myself at dinner, taking two or even three helpings of whatever delicious meal my wife cooked up. One of the best side effects about this regiment in my opinion is that it freed me from being a slave to food. 
It's really not that hard to go 4 hours without eatin if you eat regular meals. I also found it was much easier to not eat my feelings when I was bored or felt stressed. 

Here's what I would suggest: commit to following these three rules for no longer than a week to try it out. Be conscious of what you eat and when. 
Then, afterwords you can re-evaluate what worked and didn't work, and incorporate these rules into your life on an ongoing basis in a way that works for you. 

If you choose to make this plan an ongoing part of your fitness lifestyle, **make sure you have a cheat day** for special occasions, going out with friends, or just pizza and movie night.
It's important that your diet doesn't feel like a drag and hold you back from doing things you love. And honestly life would be pretty bland without chocolate cake every once in a while.
(The key is the 'every once in a while' part!)

Also be careful not to be too hard on yourself if you break a rule. Nutrition and fitness are a tool to enrich your life, not sticks to beat yourself with. Just label that
your cheat day, and move on. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a marathon, not a sprint.

Give it a try! And let me know how it goes for you!
