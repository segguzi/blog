It’s common knowledge today that exercising is good for you. 
And yet, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services, only 
1 in 3 children are physically active everyday, and less than 
5% of adults participate in the recommended amount of daily 
exercise. Children now spend more than 7 and ½ hours in front 
of screens. This, among other factors, has contributed to 
increasing obesity rates and heart disease in America and 
globally. It seems that many people need a reminder of why
 exercise is important.

Let’s review some of the positive effects of exercise:

- Increased energy
- Reduced risk of depression and anxiety
- Weight loss
- Reduced risk of heart disease 
- Reduced risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and 
 many age-related diseases
- Increased energy
- Increased muscle growth
- Increased quality of life and overall mood

The scientific literature is pretty unanimous on this front, 
and the list of benefits goes far beyond those listed above. 
According to modern Behavioral Medicine, “Physical activity and 
physical-activity interventions have beneficial effects across 
several physical and mental-health outcomes.” Across the board, 
those who participate in regular physical activity “display more 
desirable health outcomes across a variety of physical conditions.” 

According to the Harvard Health Blog, those who biked had almost 
half the rate of heart disease, cancer, or premature death. 
Analysis also showed that runner’s experiences a 40% lower risk 
of premature death, and were estimated to gain seven hours of life 
for every hour they spent running.

All right, all right that’s a bunch of scientific jargon though. 
What about day to day effects? According to the American Psychological 
Association, regular exercise has a strong mood enhancing effect called 
‘The Exercise Effect.’ This affects not only short term mood throughout 
the day, but also long term psychological conditions like depression: 
“There's good epidemiological data to suggest that active people are 
less depressed than inactive people.”

According to science daily, exercise is strongly and consistently 
linked to reduced fatigue and higher energy levels. While it seems 
strange that expending energy in exercise would “increase feelings of 
energy and reduce fatigue,” it is true. I suppose bodies at rest tend 
to stay at rest, and bodies in motion tend to stay in motion!

All of these benefits are on top of the obvious effects: weight loss, 
muscle growth, building a stronger and more capable body, looking good, 
and perhaps even finding a hobby. So, if you take your health, happiness, 
and quality of life seriously, I highly recommend you begin exercising. 
The positive effects on health and lifestyle are undeniable, and backed 
by irrefutable scientific (and anecdotal) evidence. 

So let’s go through this fitness journey together. If you are out of 
shape and don’t know how to even begin, keep an eye out for the next 
post in this series called ‘Fitness 102: Getting Started’ for a roadmap 
on how to build a healthier, happier future!
